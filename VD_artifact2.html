<p> I started by coming up with the character. I decided to make a character based on my dog (his name is Tiger) and the Disney movie Bolt. My character looks like a dog. He is wearing a red cape with a blue T in the middle for his name, it's like his logo. My character would be in a game that saves other animals from danger. He's like the dog version of superman. He even has a sidekick who is a frog wizard and his name is james. Their purpose in the game is to save all the little creatures who need help. At the end of the day when they are done fighting crime they go back to their little mushroom house and wait for the next crime.
