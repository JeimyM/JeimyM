<p> I started by picking out what color I wanted to use to be like the theme. I chose the color red. Then I started looking for pictures that matched with red or had the same vibe to it. I don't really know what my vibe is but when I think about it I mostly see red. I include pictures that I really liked and thought would fit together. I think my collage does reflect my aesthetic but not one that people see when they look at me. I think that I have different vibes and aesthetics when I'm in school and at home. Overall, Iâ€™m really proud of how this came out, the pictures, layouts and the color.   <p/>
