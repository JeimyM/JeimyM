<p> I first started by picking out the image I wanted to use. I picked this butterfly image because I thought it would look nice. I used a flower as my shape base. I chose to use the colors purple and yellow because I thought they would blend together really nicely. I also added a little bit of shadow. After doing all the duplications and rotations I noticed that it was making a spiral. In the end it made a spiral of  purple and yellow flowers.
