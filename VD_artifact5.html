The animals I decided to use were a raccoon, cat and a dog. I used the raccoon's body, the cat's head and the dog's hands/paws. To turn these animals into one first I erased the backgrounds from the images. Then I erased any other parts of the animal's body that I didn't need like for the raccoon. I erased its head and hands. For the cat I only kept the head and for the dog only his hands.
