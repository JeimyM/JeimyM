I will be writing about the pop art celebrity portrait that I did. The celebrity that I chose was Taylor Swift. I chose her because she's one of my favorite music artists. So first I was  looking for the picture I would use of her to turn  into pop art. I decided to use the cover of her new  album Midnights. After that i opened it in photoshop.
